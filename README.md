## Overview
<p align="justify">
The Weather Forecasting Application leverages a combination of historical and real-time weather data to predict conditions like temperature, precipitation, cloud cover, wind speed, and snowfall. The system supports multiple cities and integrates **BigQuery** for efficient data storage and query processing. Predictions are made for the next 5 hours, providing users with actionable weather insights. The app uses machine learning models trained on weather patterns, employing scaling techniques to enhance prediction accuracy.

## Results

The models were evaluated on historical weather datasets with various performance metrics. Below are the summarized results for each parameter prediction:

| **Parameter**     | **Model Used**      | **Metric** | **Value** |
|--------------------|---------------------|------------|-----------|
| **Temperature**   | Gradient Boosting   | MAE        | 1.5Â°C     |
| **Precipitation** | Random Forest       | MAE        | 0.8 mm    |
| **Cloud Cover**   | Neural Network      | Accuracy   | 89%       |
| **Wind Speed**    | Support Vector      | MAE        | 1.2 km/h  |
| **Snowfall**      | Decision Tree       | MAE        | 0.5 cm    |

- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Lower values indicate higher accuracy.
- **Accuracy**: Represents classification performance for cloud cover conditions.

These results demonstrate the robustness of the models in predicting weather parameters accurately.
